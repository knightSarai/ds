# DS
Notes and code snippets for data structures and algorithms written in TypeScript, including unit test implementations.

## Motivation
When it comes to learning advanced or fundamental concepts, I believe the best way to learn them is by breaking them down into smaller parts.
It's like dividing and conquering the learning process. And you know what? Unit testing and Test-Driven Development (TDD) are awesome companions for this approach.

## Usage
Instead of running the code files directly, I prefer to interact with them through the tests.

Run `nx run test --testFile <file-name>` to run the tests for a specific file.

There's no need to type the full file name, for example, `nx run test --testFile 01` will run the tests for the `01-arrays` file.

Run `nx test .` to execute all the unit tests.
