# Ds

When it comes to learning advanced concepts,
I believe the best way to learn them is by breaking them down into smaller parts.
It's like dividing and conquering the learning process. And you know what? Unit testing and Test-Driven Development (TDD) are awesome companions for this approach.

## Runnig the tests
Instead of running the code files directly, I prefer to interact with them through the tests.

Run `nx run test --testFile <file-name>` to run the tests for a specific file.
There's no need to type the full file name, for example, `nx run test --testFile 01` will run the tests for the `01-arrays` file.

Run `nx test .` to execute all the unit tests
