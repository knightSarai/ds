When the computer reads a value at a particular index of an array, it can jump straight to that index because of the combination of the following facts about computers:
1. A computer can jump to any memory address in one step.
2. Whenever a computer allocates an array, it also makes note at which memory address the array begins. 
   So, if we asked the computer to find the first element of the array, it would be able to instantly jump to the appropriate memory address to find it.
3. A computer can also find the value at any index byperforming simple addition.
