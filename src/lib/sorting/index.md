# Bubble sort
In bubble-sort.ts file I have 3 ways of writing bubble sort and I really do like The first one!
The steps are abvious as we start by the max and decrement max on each iteration.
The second solution the boundaries are not clear as on the second loop we use

`j < arr.length - 1 - i`

It's  almost hidden!

The third solution we have to track sorted state in order for this algorithm to work properly!
But it might be the most efficient one!
